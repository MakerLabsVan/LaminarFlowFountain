# Laminar Flow Fountain
Co-op Project: Stuti Arya

#Project Description 
The system below is a Laminar Flow Fountain that converts the turbulent water stream at the inlet to a smooth laminar stream at the outlet.The stream is lit using an optical fiber tube. The systems also incorporates a cutter that divides the water stream at the outlet into desired volumes.

#Material Required

4" ABS Pipe
400 Drinking Straws
Window Mesh
Optical fibers
Scrub Pads
Threaded Rods 
Acrylic/Aluminum for the endcaps
Arduino Uno
EasyDriver v4.5
STM100 Stepper Motor
High Power 3W Led
Switch

#Software Required 
[Arduino] (https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software)


#Constructing the Nozzle
- Drill a 1 inch hole on the side of the pipe (4’’ ID and 16’’ (in length) ABS pipe) at a distance of 1.5 inches from the inlet endcap.
- Place 1 layer of scrub pads inside the pipe at the inlet. The distance between the scrub pads and the end cap should be approximately 5 inches.
- Place the window mesh supported by a circular ring (piece of pipe) on top of the scrub pads.
- Put approximately 350 straws on top of the window mesh. These straw should be even on the side of the outlet and approximately 2 inches from the stream outlet.
-Place 6 optical fibers (~ 16 inches in length) in a straw and place the optical fiber tube in line with the outlet. The distance between the optical fibers and the stream outlet should be at least 0.75 inches.
- Place 2 balloons inside the pipe near the nozzle inlet to absorb the vibrations and stabilize the pressure fluctuations.
- For the outlet cap, drill a 1.4’’ bevel hole in a ¼’’ acrylic end cap and sand the water outlet with sand papers of grit 220, 400, 1000 and 2000 respectively.
Integrate all the components using threaded stainless steel rods.

#Stream Cutter

- Mount the motor on an acrylic cap (see Inkscape file for the design). Cut a piece of stainless steel and bend it in a zig zag shape.
- Attach the cutter arm on the motor using an acrylic washer that is tight fitted on the motor shaft.
